# Project Status

## Actual Status

Project ist finished / placed on hold.

## Suggested ToDo in further Development

Since the main purpose of the project was to reflect the Data Science Lifecycle some important steps has been skipped. 

In further development the model-training and tuning might could learn from the earlier model-steps. This is a major issue in the project.
